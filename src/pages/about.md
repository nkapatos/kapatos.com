# Thank you for taking the time to visit my site and learn a bit about me!

## Firstly, let me introduce myself

I'm Nikos or officially the longer version Nikolaos, I am a software engineer currently living in Berlin, Germany.

## Professional Journey

Throughout my career, I've gained valuable insights and experience exploring the connections between technology and various professional domains. Some notable moments in my journey that I'm particularly proud of include streamlined workflows and proposals that reshaped product teams and technology infrastructures, aligning product, design, development, and Quality Assurance with automated test pipelines and design systems, and mentoring software engineers to help them develop their skills and grow into leadership roles.

I've successfully led technical projects such as migrating and consolidating serverless functions, resulting in improved API contracts and reduced operational costs. Additionally, I facilitated the introduction of monthly meetings aimed at aligning products and technology like the Architects Board and Show and Tell sessions and supported, on occasions, extreme programming while cultivating the skills and openness for principles like YAGNI, among other things. These meetings encouraged open participation and accountability, resulting in informed decision-making and better alignment with the vision.

## Philosophy

My personal philosophy is that adaptability is vital to success in any endeavor. As such, I always strive to create flexible solutions that can evolve with changing circumstances. I approach decision-making with a data-driven mindset but rely heavily on emotional intelligence to navigate life's complexities. I'm fascinated by diversity and enjoy finding common ground in diverse environments.

## Tech Stack

Although I'm always curious to explore technologies and software development patterns, my toolbelt will always be equipped with Typescript, Angular, NestJS, Postgres, and containers - either for enterprise solutions that need to last long or the "next developer who will take over knows my address[^1]" and for rapid prototyping and PoCs. For side projects or cases that the company, product, and tech teams can support and require, Go and Rust come into play to support the ever-evolving requirements of almost all software.

## Other Interests

Outside of work, I have a few hobbies that keep me busy. I am an avid photographer interested in capturing architecture, landscapes, and candid moments. I also love to travel and experience different cultures whenever I can. And when I need to clear my head and escape from it all, there is nothing quite like a long motorcycle ride. Besides these hobbies, I still explore new technologies, software development, leadership, and management practices. Being a lifelong student in these fields is part of my interests, and I enjoy learning about them as much as possible.

In conclusion, I hope my perspectives and experiences will inspire you in your own journey. If you have any questions or want to chat, please don't hesitate to reach out.
